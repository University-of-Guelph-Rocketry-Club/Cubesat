# UofG Rocketry Club – CubeSat Project

Welcome to the **University of Guelph Rocketry Club's CubeSat Project** repository! 🚀🛰️  
This project represents our team’s efforts to design, build, and test a CubeSat platform for space research and technology demonstrations.

## 📖 About the Project
The CubeSat initiative is a student-led project aimed at:
- Designing a CubeSat that follows the 1U/3U CubeSat standard.
- Developing **avionics systems** for control, communication, and power management.
- Integrating payload experiments for scientific research and data collection.
- Preparing for **future launch opportunities** and competitions.
